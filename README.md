*Reason to Choose these Project

*Workdone

1)Reason to Choose these Project-: As I personally curious to know technology and logic behind this snake games which we were playing since childhood.

2)Basic programming methods which I used in these project are-: turtle.screen(), head.shape(), def go_direction(), def move(), onkey()

3)Workdone-:

*Import libraries- Turtle, Random and time.

*By using turtle.screen() formed a screen for game, for that screen I used code to set backgorund, width and colour.

*Head.shape used for head of snake and also some colour, I kept head.shape initially 0 during start of game.

*Then done with snake food by assigning food shape, colour and speed initially 0. I Used food.goto(0, 200) so that food can display on right hand side, in this case x axis is 0 and y axis is 200.

*Then done with scoreboard display by using sc.shape, sc.color and sc.goto(0, 260) for scoreboard position

*To defined snake movement I used head.direction, in this case if condition is head.direction!= down, then head will move towards Up direction.

*Then I used onkey function to defined keys for Up/down/right/left movement.
