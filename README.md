*Reason to Choose these Project

*Workdone

1)Reason to Choose these Project-: As personally curious to know technology and logic behind games which we were playing sine childhood

2)Basic programming Methods which are used in these project-: turtle.screen(), head.shape(), def go_direction(), def move(), onkey()

3)Workdone-:

*Import Turtle, Random and time libraries

*By using turtle.screen() formed a screen for game, in that assigned scree title, background colour, width/ height.

*By using head.shape assigned shape of snake head also used head.color and head.shape by keeping initially 0.

*Then done with snake food by assigning food shape, color and speed initially 0. Used food.goto(0, 200) so that food can display on right hand side, in this x axis is 0 and y axis is 200.

*Then done with scoreboard display by using sc.shape, sc.color and sc.goto(0, 260) for scoreboard position.

*To defined snake movement used head.direction, in this if condition is head.direction!= down, then head will move towards Up direction.

*Then defined snake movement for continous movement, means if snake going at end of up direction it will return from down.

*Then defined keys by using onkey function.

*Then assigned new segment to head each time by using append function.
